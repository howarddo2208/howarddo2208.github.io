If you find neovim hard to get started, you can consider using NvChad , LunarVim or any other preconfiged neovim setup\nVisual Studio Code Terminal setup:\nhere is my dotfiles , have a look! My terminal setup highly revolves around zsh shell, neovim config and tmux (a terminal multiplexer).\nTerminal Emulator - Wezterm : I choose this over allacritty, kitty and iTerm because it support all platforms and got nice feature right out of a box like copy mode without mouse, etc\nsome other useful terminal stuffs here\ncheat.sh: the only cheat sheet you need lazygit: simple terminal UI for git commands Docker : quickly setup dev environment with image and containers\nngrok : for sharing localhost ports (I rarely use it)\nproductivity personal knowledge management - logseq + Notion : I think there is no need to talk about notion because you probably knew about it already, but Logseq is the best app I’ve ever used to take notes, manage my knowledge and everything in my life. Its block approach makes it really easy to connect existing data, and ideas in your graph together, and it is open-source with a big collection of tutorials/plugins for its user base too. The data are fully managed by you. I highly recommend you try it. peer-to-peer syncing: Syncthing : One caveat of using logseq is that if you don’t spend money to support the current development, you have to find your own way to sync data. So many people turn to this app to sync their data, after using it for a while, now I think it is the best syncing app out there, it use P2P network and not store your data on any of the cloud service. Right now I use it to sync my logseq graph and downloaded musics, videos, series, etc between my phone and laptop.\ntranslator: Reverso flashcards: Anki + logseq flashcards feature\nvideo editor - DaVinci Resolve : the free version is good. I don’t want to pay for expensive Adobe apps at all\nsites, appblocker\nMobile - Stay Focused : I find this especially useful to limit my phone usage, if you want to buy it, there is a lifetime plan, no more annoying subscription plan.

You can install straight at the app store but after you need to install the hidden addons to access variety of torrent streams.\nhidden addons : best one are torentino and the pirate bay. Install trakt addon if wanting to track your history. Cloudstream : android only, I just discovered it and it seems nice, got the download functionality out of the box, but I will stick with Stremio because of the trakt itegration\nmusic\nI mainly use adblocked Spotify\ndesktop: SpotX: Modified Spotify client.

I will add a link to windows/linux alternative if I find one\nhide excess menu bar icons: hidden : if you have too many menu bar icons, this free app can help you, if you got some money, you can consider getting Bartender as I heard it is better\nkeyboard mappers: Karabiner-Elements quick file transfer, sharing with drag and drop drawer - Dropover : I bought it by 1-time payment, really useful.
