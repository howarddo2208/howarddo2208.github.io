Why Nix? I first came across Nix from a YouTube video of Mental Outlaw and was fascinated to learn that I can use Nix to quickly migrate development environment to other machines, pretty awesome, right?

I hope that you can find something useful in this curated list and use them in your setup.
I&amp;rsquo;m a poor boy in a third-world country, so my setup would include many free, pirated stuffs, don&amp;rsquo;t arrest me please :P
All the tech listed here will be updated over time when I found better alternatives or add something new</description></item></channel></rss>
